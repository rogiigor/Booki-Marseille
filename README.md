The company wants to create a website where users can find accommodation and activities in their <br>chosen city.

Your role is to create the website interface using HTML and CSS code. On this project, you’ll be working closely with Sarah, the CTO, and Luke, the UI designer. 

Sarah sends you an email to inform you about how the project is progressing.

**Subject**: Booki mock-ups<br>
**From**: Sarah<br>
**To**: Me<br>

Hello,                                                                         

Luke has finished the desktop, tablet, and mobile mock-ups for the website! You can now start building them. I’ve attached the mock-ups to this email. 

To be sure you have a clear understanding of the project, Luke and I have prepared a project brief (attached) that consolidates all of the specifications and technical constraints you’ll need to adhere to.

 

To help get you started, I’ve created the site’s file structure and some starter code: 

An “index.html” file containing the starter HTML code that you’ll need to expand on.
A “css” folder containing one or more “style.css” files with an initial draft of the code that you’ll also need to expand on.
An “images” folder containing all of the images we’ll be using on the website.
 

There’s already some code provided to give you some HTML and CSS code to start with. You can base the rest of your code on this, and you’ll need to adhere to the same folder structure.
You then need to send me the full project folder via GitHub. Make sure to use the version control on Git as you work through the development.


Good luck on this project, and have a great day!

Sarah, CTO @Booki
